Freelancer Project Bidding Platform
This project demonstrates how to design and implement a Freelancer Project Bidding Platform using the MERN stack. The design follows modular principles where input and display are separated into Form and List components.
Consistency across modules (Tasks, Projects, Bids) makes the system easier to extend and maintain.
The platform encourages transparency and accountability by integrating authentication, project management, bidding, and task tracking. Features

- Role-based access (Client / Freelancer)  
- Protected routes for logged-in users  

Projects
- Clients can **create, edit, delete** projects  
- Add descriptions, skills, and budget ranges

Bids

- View personal bidding history  

Tasks
- Add, edit, delete personal tasks
